# Hi, I'm Maxwell Odoom! 👨‍💻

### About Me

I am a 💻 dedicated trainee programmer with a strong focus on backend development, particularly using the powerful tools, Python with Django Rest Framework and Java with Spring Boot. I am passionate about building scalable and maintainable APIs that form the backbone of web applications.
